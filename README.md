# London, Like a Local
<h1>CF:G Ruby Project</h1>

This is a cool web app project to tell you about events going on in areas of London!

<h2> Setup </h2>
To start the app, run `ruby server.rb` in the command line.

<h2> Instructions </h2>
Simply enter the area of London you want to focus on and a keyword for the activity you want to do, such as 'food', 'theatre' or even 'cheese' (everyone loves a cheese themed event!).
