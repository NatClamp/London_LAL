# London, Like a Local
<h1>CF:G Ruby Project</h1>
<p>This is a cool web app project to tell you about events going on in areas of London!</p>

<p>The app is deployed <a href="http://londonlikealocal.herokuapp.com/">here</a> on heroku.</p>

<p>We had some great news - this app <b>won</b> the <b>CodeFirst: Girls</b> project competition for the Advances Ruby course held in Paddington early 2018!</p>

<h2> How to use our code</h2>
<h3> Setup </h3>
To start the app, run `ruby server.rb` in the command line.

<h3> Instructions </h3>
Simply enter the area of London you want to focus on and a keyword for the activity you want to do, such as 'food', 'theatre' or even 'cheese' (everyone loves a cheese themed event!).
